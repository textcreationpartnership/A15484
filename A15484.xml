            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Looke how duely thou refreſheſt thy body, by uſe of repaſt or recreation; ſo often at the leaſt be ſure to cheare up thy ſoule by the uſe of thy faith. Let thy ſoule have two or three walkes a day up to Mount Tabor, that is, into ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred place of Meditation and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſuch as <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Field, <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Leades, <hi>David</hi>'s Cloſet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is there to be done?

            <p>And this in plaine termes, I call, uſing of faith, and living by faith; which if thou wilt duely inure thy ſelf unto, thou wilt not marvell why I call it, aſcending Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> thou wilt ſtay thy ſelfe upon good proof: It is good to be here, daily to be here, often to come hither, oh that this did as clearly appeare to the world in this matter of faith, as it doth in all other habits, graces, gifts, vertues, and good things whatſoever; that the principall beautie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of them conſiſts in uſe, fruition and action; (not the bare profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yea, the very increaſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them.

The more thou doſt, the more thou mayeſt: Vſe will bring perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thorough diſuſe things pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and come to nothing. As the Plough-ſhare laid up ruſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20864:8"/> employed gliſters, doth good, and laſts the longer. Let any man diligently and throughly improve, the greater will be his faith, and great comfort it will bring in.</p>
            <p>And againe, after the end of the Sermon in his Epiſtle to the Reader, (which he purpoſely then enters and not before it) to leave the better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he hath a farther paſſage to this effect. Let me miniſter unto thee an Interrogatory or two; and anſwer me in good ſerious ſooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and thy ſoul, Haſt thou and doſt thou thy ſelf (letting others alone) live by faith? Proove and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thyſelfe, and take for inſtance this preſent week or day paſt wherin thou readeſt this little Manual, How haſt thou or uſually doſt thou ſpend the day? What thought didſt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake withal? what was the morning draught for thy foule next thy heart? What hath cheered and made thee merrie in private and in company, whether thy ſports or thy meales more then the heavenly ejaculations?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20864:9"/> Deale plainly (not with me and this Booke, which yet ſhall witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, if thou refuſe to practiſe it, when thou haſt read it) but with thy ſelfe. Haſt not thou challenged ſome time (more or leſſe) halfe a quarter of an houre at the leaſt in the day, for this exerciſe of thy faith? if not (as it is neglected by moſt men, not for dayes, or weekes, but for moneths and yeares) let thy heart ſmite thee for thy folly and ſay, have I lived, or rather not lived, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming pretious time in vanities? How commeth it about, that the greateſt part of my life, is the leaſt part wherein I have lived? Oh then recover and recollect thy ſelfe before thou go hence; wilt thou die before thou haſt lived? as boies ſlabber their books, before they have learned their leſſons: Oh learn to live this life; it is never too late, it is never (I am ſure) too ſoone. It is no ſhame for thee to learne it, of what age or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoever thou be.</p>

               <p>NOw (my ſoule) that by Gods mercy and goodneſſe we are withdrawen from the world, into this ſolitary Mountaine; where our bleſſed Saviour the Lord IESUS was transfigured in divine glory, before his ſuffering in his humanitie; that his Diſciples thereby diſcerning both his natures in one perſon, might be aſſured that he was that true promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah, God manifeſted in the fleſh, for the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: Let our meditations be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the conſideration of thoſe glorious benefits, which the faithfull ſoule receiveth from this bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world: wherein our firſt remembrance propounded unto us, is; How excellent a thing it is, to have all our debts cancelled: that is to ſay; to have all our ſinnes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged:

                  </gap>n the XVIII. Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> we read of a King that would take accompt of his ſervants, Verſ. XXIV. and when he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him a thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and having not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20864:13"/> wife and children and all that hee had, and paiment to be made. Such a miſerable debtor (O Lord my God and Saviour) am I: my debts being not of pence, but of talents, and that not ſingle, but thouſand-fold: and all of them of ſuch nature, as the world (if I had it in my power to diſpoſe of) cannot ſatisfie divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the leaſt of them; and yet there can be no diſcharg of the debt, no remiſſion of my ſinnes without ſatisfaction. For mercy and juſtice are in our God both eſſentiall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the one exceed the other, where they are both infinite. Oh then, where ſhall I wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finde in heaven or earth a pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infinite value, to anſwer and ſatisfie this infinite juſtice, for my manifold and grievous offences? What ſurety will come in to be my baile, in this deſperate and forlorne condition? this ſatisfaction can no way be made but by thine own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſelfe (O moſt gracious Lord IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, one only Saviour) who being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20864:13"/> God and Man in one perſon, haſt vouchſafed out of thine infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſſe, together with our fraile nature, to take alſo our debts, all our ſinnes upon thy ſelfe; and ſo (as my moſt glorious ſurety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer) to free me from that inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burthen, which otherwiſe had preſſed me downe to the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hell. It being not poſſible that the blacke lines of my debts of ſinne could bee croſſed or blotted out of Gods debt-booke by any other meanes, then by the red lines of thy moſt precious blood. For thou only (O Lord) art the alſufficient and propitiatory ſacrifice, whereby divine juſtice is fully ſatisfied for all the ſins of every true penitent that believes in thee.</p>
               <p>Therefore in all true humiliation of ſoule, hungring and thirſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy ſalvation (O bleſſed IESUS, my Lord and my God, thus crucified for me) doe I proſtrate my ſelf at thy glorious foot-ſtoole; beſeeching thee by thy grace to ſtrike my heard and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20864:14"/> ſtonie heart, that in all contrition of ſoule I may ſpend my ſelfe into the tears of unfained repentance for the manifold ſins and wickednes, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, prophanneſſe, unthankfulnes, and unfruitfulnes of my life paſt, and then withall by the ſame thy graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, to lift up my penitent and afflicted ſoule, by the hands of an humble and lively faith, to lay faſt hold upon thee (my bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and moſt glorious Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) that ſo this alſufficient ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thine applyed to my ſoule and conſcience, and by faith become mine, may make me aſſured, that all my huge and burthenſome debts are cancelled, and my ſins remitted, that they may never affright my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence any more. For I know O Lord and aſſuredly believe, that how great or grievous ſoever my ſinnes have beene, yet there can be no ſins unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable to an infinite mercy, nor any ſins ſo hainous or multiplyed, but the infinite merit of thy precious death and paſſion can and doth fully expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20864:14"/> and diſcharge the ſame for ever, to every true penitent and believing ſoule. Oh then (moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) quicken I beſeech thee, and ſtrengthen my weak and feeble faith by thy gracious ſpirit; to make ſuch a powerfull and effectuall applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this thy moſt gracious ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for me, to my wounded and fearefull conſcience, as may quiet the ſame for ever: In aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that all my debts are paid, and croſſed out of GODS Debt-booke by thee my moſt bleſſed ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never to bee demanded of mee againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give mee grace (O Lord</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS) <hi>not to ſtand onely poring and gazing upon my ſinnes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of confuſion, but to lift up the the eyes of my ſoule unto thee (my gracious Saviour) the proper object of conſolation, and to be ſo wholly and truly enflamed with thy love, as that I may for ever with al awful reverence

               </p>
               <p>And now (O my ſoule) let us rouze up our dull and heavie ſpirits, and rejoyce together with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious; let us ſing and be merrie in the Lord: for he is the Lord our God, even the God of our ſalvation: And we ſhall tenne times more honour him, in obeying his commandement, by believing in him whom hee hath ſent into the world for our redemption, and ſhall much better pleaſe him in truſting to his mercy, and ſealing to his truth in the bleſſed performance of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, in the promiſed Meſſiah, then in doubting of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie by reaſon of our ſinnes, or fearing his juſtice againſt us, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Lord IESUS hath already ſatisfied for us, to our finall peace and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20864:15"/> ſalvation. Let us then cheere up our ſelves in this bleſſed comfort of all comforts, our debts are all paid and cancelled, our Paſchall Lambe is ſlaine: CHRIST IESUS hath made all our dayes holy-dayes; have any more cauſe to bee merrie then wee? Away then with droopings and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfulneſſe: for the Lord hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our ſorrow into joy, and ſuch joy as ſhall never bee taken from us: Bleſſed be the name of the Lord our God for ever.</p>
               <p>And now (O moſt glorious and gracious Redeemer) who art the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of my faith, perfect the good work of thy grace begun in me, that by daily renewing of my humble faith and repentance, by theſe weake and unworthy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mine, I may with joy and gladneſſe, comfort and cheerfulneſſe, walk before thee this day, and all the remaining dayes of my earthly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage; waiting for thy bleſſed calling of me to thy ſelfe in glory, when my faith ſhall bee turned into

               <head>The third Meditation</head>
               <p>Now (my ſoul) are we by Gods mercy come to the third ſtep of theſe our Meditations; which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth to our conſideration, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a thing it is to be the child of God. In our firſt ſtep, when we lay firſt bound in the chains of our ſins, under the inſupportable waight of numberleſſe talents of debts, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us, our moſt gracious Saviour the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> bleſſed for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our ſurety, took our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, God manifeſted in the fleſh, paid all our debts, ſatisfied divine juſtice for all our ſinnes, and ſo ſet us at liberty, and made us freemen In our ſecond ſtep, he brought us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a further degree of favour, to make our God whom we had ſo grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended and provoked to become friends with us, and appeaſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. And now in the third
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20864:25"/> place wee are brought to bee more than friends, children of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moſt glorious God himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby we are entitled to demand and challenge at his fatherly hands, not only ſafe protection from al dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and evils, and carefull proviſion both for ſoul and body in this life, but alſo an eternal inheritance of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory in the life to come. And how comes it to paſſe (ô my ſoul) that ſo wretched and worthies a creature as my unworthy ſelf ſhould be advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe glorious priviledges, and high dignity of being made and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted a child of the moſt high? our God hath but one only ſon by nature even G d the ſon, very God of very God, the ſecond perſon of the moſt holy, glorious and ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, in and by whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as (in our former medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) I was redeemed from my ſinnes, and reconciled unto God: ſo it is in and by him only that I and all the reſt of his redeemed ones doe receive the adoption of ſonnes: even
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20864:26"/> ſo (O moſt bleſſed Lord God and heavenly father) becauſe it ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, through IESUS CHRIST our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom our humble and true faith apprehending, we receive from him into our hearts the bleſſed ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father; the ſame ſpirit bearing witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God, by faith in CHRIST IESUS, as in the ſeverall places of holy Scripture before nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appeareth.</p>
               <p>O then (my ſoule) let us now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by this third ſtep and meditation, take this juſt and fit opportunity for renewing of our daily repentance, and of our humble faith in this moſt gracious Saviour of ours, for our lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt hold upon him, who by theſe bleſſed degrees hath brought us to this high priviledge of being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
               <p>And true faith I find to be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Faith is a filiall confidence in God, conceived of the knowledge of CHRIST, and the love of the father
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20864:26"/> in him; whereby man runneth unto God, and cryeth unto him, Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In which lively faith there is a twofold operation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an apprehending vertue by which the believer receives and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to himſelfe IESUS CHRIST, as he is offered in the word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a rendring vertue, (ſo to call it) whereby the believer goes out of himſelfe into the Lord. <hi>Qui credit in Chriſtum tranſit in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum.</hi> By the firſt CHRIST becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ours, by the ſecond we reſigne our ſelves unto CHRIST, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his. And theſe are the two hands of faith. By the one we receive mercy from God, by the other, wee render ſon-like obedience unto him: and if we believe (as we ought to do) that God is become our Father, and do ſo apprehend him in Chriſt; then ought we again to ſhew by our chang of life and new obedience, that wee have rendred our ſelves to be his. For
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20864:27"/> of all thoſe that came to CHRIST in the Goſpell, none went away as they came; and they that are truly in him, get vertue from him, which workes in them the ſimilitude of his owne life, ſo as this meditation (O my ſoule) doth properly ſpread it ſelfe into two branches. Firſt the glorious priviledges and comforts, wee receive by our adoption, and then our moſt bounden duties to our moſt gracious God for the ſame.</p>
               <p>There is a naturall adoption, which is defined to be, a lawfull act imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature, found out for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, who have no children of their owne, but this ſpirituall ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of us differs farre from it: For it is, a lawfull act tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, found out by the Lord our God, for the comfort of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that want a father. Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature miſerable Orphans, having no father to provide for us; It pleaſed the Lord our God to become our father in Chriſt, and to make us his ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20864:27"/> by adoption, not for any benefit he receives of us, for nothing can ariſe by the meanes of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to that moſt high and alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Majeſtie) but that hee might have ſome upon whom to beſtow his benefits, for the declaration of the glory of his rich mercy Yet both ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions agree in this, that they flow from the pleaſure and goodneſſe of the adoptant, and that there are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him that is adopted, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a ſon which by nature he hath not but where the naturall ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptant cannot change the nature of the partie adopted. It is otherwiſe with us: For if God by the grace of adoption make us his ſonnes, he will alſo by the grace of regeneration make us new creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever continues in ſinne, cannot challeng, any intereſt in this divine priviledge, only the ſanctified are entitled to it.</p>
               <p>Here alſo let us to our unſpeakable comfort obſerve, that the ſonnes of God know moſt certainly that God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20864:28"/> is become their heavenly Father. For in this that they are taught of God by his owne ſpirit to acknowledge him and call upon him with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as upon their father, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived of their generation: but with more freedome of ſpirit, yea, and ſurer knowledge they call God their Father, then any ſon of the world is able to call upon his earthly Father.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we are taught, that we cannot pray unto God but by the ſpirit of adoption, who is the parent that begets prayer, as the mother who conceives it, is the humble and contrite heart: For no proud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, or hard heart can pray unto God. And certainly unleſſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit teſtifie unto us that God is our father, and hath made us his children, wee dare not goe neere him, to crave good things from him, and therefore herein appeareth the Fatherly indulgence of our God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
               <p>We are here in the valley of death,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20864:28"/> in heavines through continuall affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and temptations. The time is not yet come, wherin the Lord will communicate unto us his glorious preſence, to fil us with that fulnes of joy which is in that bleſſed viſion; The time is not yet come, wherein we muſt aſcend to our father: yet to keep us in the meane time that wee faint not, the Lord hath ſent down his holy ſpirit into our hearts, to comfort us. O fatherly care! O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull love! That ſpirit the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcended once according to CHRISTS promiſe upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in a viſible manner, and doth daily deſcend in a ſecret and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner into the hearts of the godly, leſt the children of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage chamber ſhould be ſwallowed up with heavines, through the want of their Bridegroome. And this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ambaſſador teacheth us to cry unto God, as upon our Father: which if we doe with this ſpirit of adoption, it is effectuall enough to draw downe upon us all thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20864:29"/> which the Lord communicates to his children: His name ſhall bee ſanctified in us; his kingdom ſhall be advanced in us; we ſhall not want our daily bread; he will forgive us all our ſins; and preſerve us that we fall not into temptation, and deliver us from evil For all comforts reſt under this name of father: if we can ſo call him in faith, the riches of his mercies are ours.</p>
               <p>O (bleſſed Lord God,) what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man ſhould I bee in holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, and heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe, anſwerable to this high and holy calling? and how unworthy a wretch have I ſhewed my ſelfe of ſo great mercy: when inſtead of worſhipping, fearing, loving, and obeying this moſt gracious Lord and heavenly father, in all things I have yeelded to the fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>NOw (my ſoule) hath the Lord in mercy brought us to a fourth ſtep of theſe our meditations, which is a bleſſed conſequent of the three former. For being redeemed from our ſinnes, which was our firſt ſtep, and in the ſecond, received to our heavenly Father; and in the third, made his children by grace and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; we are thereby become ſure upon our perſeverance in grace, of finall ſalvation: which brings us to this fourth ſtep, making our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (even in this earthly pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage) moſt happy and ſafe; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, temptations, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, torments, we ſhall or may be exerciſed withall in our way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

               <head>The Fifth MEDITATION.</head>
               <p>NOw (my ſoul) are we by Gods goodneſſe come to the fifth ſtep of theſe our meditations, to conſider how full of ſweet comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment the life of him is, or ought to bee, that lives without feare of death and hell. Death being in its owne nature the extreameſt of evils in this life, the king of terrors to every living thing, and hell the moſt horrible dungeon of everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: to the juſt feare of both which the wicked of the world are every minute ſubject. None but thoſe children of grace here, that are ſure of their ſalvation hereafter, can live this pleaſant and feareleſſe life. There is a firſt and a ſecond death, the death of the ſoule, (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) went before, in the ſoules departure from God, and the death of the body followed, by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20864:36"/> the ſoules departing from the body, the ſoule firſt left God willingly, yea wilfully; and therefore is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled unwillingly to leave the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now from both theſe deaths are we delivered by the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For our ſoules being by him freed from ſinne, are reconciled unto God, and ſo exempt from that wrath to come; and from the power of the ſecond death for ever. And from the firſt death, we are ſo delivered from it, that albeit in the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it be the center of all miſeries, and a fearefull effect of Gods curſe on man for ſinne; yet to the godly the nature of it is alſo changed; ſo as now it is not the death of the man, but the death of ſinne in the man. Death (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) is the buriall of all vices: for it is the progreſſe and accompliſhment of the full mortification of all our earthly members, wherein that filthie flux of ſinne is dryed up in an inſtant, it as a voluntary ſacrificing of the whole man, ſoule and body to the Lord,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20864:36"/> the greateſt and the higheſt ſervice wee can doe to him on earth. For where in the courſe of our life wee are continually fighting againſt our inordinate luſts and affections, to bring them in ſubjection to Chriſt; by death (as it were by one ſtroke) they are all ſmitten and ſlaine: and the ſoule is offered up unto God in a ſacrifice of full and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And though this mortall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle muſt bee laid to ſleepe for a time in the grave, (which is Gods m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In the firſt right he can admit no companion; in the ſecond all the members of his myſticall body are made partakers with him.

For, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 144.15. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are thoſe people whoſe God is the Lord, and are called to this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie fellowſhip and union with him who is the king of Saints. O my ſoul, come let us with all humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, heartily love and adore the Lord, who hath of his free grace made us partakers of this unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy: let us rejoyce and bee glad in the Lord; and let my heart and mouth be filled with his praiſes for ever. For, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.9. except the Lord had reſerved mercy for us, wee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20864:41"/> had beene made like unto <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah;</hi> whereas by this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour of ours, our moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord and husband, the lots are fallen unto us in pleaſant places, and we have a faire heritage.

And although all the adopted children of God, members of Chriſt, are heires of this glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet is not the ſame diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any one of them; for the rich portion of one ſhall bee no prejudice to another; but every one ſhall bee filled with the fulneſſe of the glory of God.</p>

For our Father is the ancient of dayes, the heavens are the worke of his hands: they ſhall periſh, but hee doth remaine; we all ſhall wax old
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20864:42"/> as doth a garment, but he is the ſame, and his yeares ſhall not faile: for he is the Father of eternitie, in whom there cannot fall ſo much as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change. But as for us, our condition is ſuch, that by ſuffering death, we muſt enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we cannot ſee him ſo long as wee live, nor bee ſatisfied with his image, till we awake in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Therefore ſhould the day of death be a ioyfull day unto us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the day of our glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. <hi>Dies mortis aeternae vitae natalis eſt;</hi> and as this ſerves unto us, for a ſpeciall comfort in the houre of temptation and day of death; ſo it ſhould provoke us, to anſwer this our heavenly vocation, by the holy and heavenly diſpoſition of our minds, and affections, whiles we live, and a gracious and Chriſtian preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from day to day for the time of our diſſolution, waiting for it with cheerfulneſſe and joy.</p>
               <p>Seeing we are the ſonnes of God, ſhall wee not make it our ſtudie and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20864:42"/> care to uſe all bleſſed meanes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his image in us, which our former ſins have defaced? and to ſerve him in holines and righteouſnes all the remaining daies of our life? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are called to be heires of an heavenly inheritance, ſhall we any longer minde and affect earthly things? nay rather with the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (<hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9.) Let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt all things to bee but dung in reſpect of the excellent knowledge and fellowſhip of the Lord IESUS. Seeing CHRIST muſt be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in death, when all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts will forſake us; let us make him out joy and pleaſure, and our portion in this life, and ſo ſhall he be both in life and death an advantage unto us.</p>

Which words pointing me (as it were) to <hi>Pauls,</hi> for the proofe of that is there alleadged,) it brings to my minde an obſervation of mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a grave-ſtone in that Church, as if it had beene one of thoſe very ſtones which the firſt author inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For at my firſt comming to London, about fiftie yeares ſince, I obſerved a very faire and large grave-ſtone of a browniſh colour, in the pavement of the middle walke of the body of that Church betweene the two pillars next the ſtaires that goe up into the chancell, wherein at the

                     <p>Sir, I ſent you in a Letter by my brother, &amp;c. In meane while, to your caſe of conſcience, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it aright, I thinke thus in few words. The Goſpell is a doctrine of mercy, but not of liberty. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, though it cannot ſave, or condemne us who are in Chriſt; yet it ſtill obligeth us (no leſſe, if not more then others) to all acts of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and juſtice. Our redeemer freed us, not from the obedience, but from the penaltie of it, the rigorous ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, is mitigated by the new covenant of grace, (for to us, is no condemnation, and if any man ſinne, we have an Advocate) But the new
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20864:89"/> Covenant is ſo far from diſſolving of any commandement, that it adds to them, the more of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And faith it ſelf, though it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of comfort in Chriſt, yet it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condition of our allegiance to God, not only in ſome feeble good purpoſes and deſires, but in a conſtant, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, actuall obedience: For faith in the very nature of it, implies obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Romanes 1.5.</hi> and <hi>16.26. 1 Peter 1.14.</hi> and verſe <hi>22.</hi> It pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the heart; <hi>Acts 15.9.</hi> It wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by love, <hi>Galatians 5.6.</hi> And without doubt, the faith which is not thus obedient, purging, working, is but a fancie. Tis true, the moſt holy Chriſtian may ſometimes by his frailtie or negligence be ſurpriſed by a ſuddaine temptation, or foiled y a violent: Jn that eaſe his comfort is in the merits of Chriſt. But tis withall his duty, ſpeedily to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelfe, and to walke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more warily with his God. Good will, or good wiſhes are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, where there is no more, I feare
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20864:89"/> there is little grace, which where it is, enables us to overcome the world. <hi>1 Ioh. 5.4.5.</hi> To reſiſt the Divell. <hi>Iam. 4.7.</hi> nay, to overcome him. <hi>1 Io. 4.4.

               <p>This Text hath two parts; the things recommended to them, and the inducment or introduction ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20864:98"/> themſelves and their worldly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; ſo there is a wiſdome whereby wee are taught to governe our ſoules unto eternall life. And if wee were as profound in policie as Machiavillians, and had all the wiſdome of the learned for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of earthly things, yet all were nothing without this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ſalvation; which wee are here exhorted unto. The feare of God is the beginning of wiſdome, for this wiſdome dwells not with wicked men. This is not every mans wiſh or deſire. The moſt affect worſer things; ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, ſome earthly riches, ſome ſenſuall pleaſure, but few that look after this heavenly Kingdome, all for the body, none for the ſoule, as if we had no ſoules to ſave; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſtirres us up to bee wiſe, that wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; which is the next part of the matter propounded; underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. What, do we not underſtand already? yes, but wee underſtand
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20864:98"/> not what belongs to our peace, and as wee ſhould underſtand unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It were a great ſteppe to grace, that wee had ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of GOD as the honeſt Heathen had, who by their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from groſſe ſinnes, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, injuſtice, anger, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered paſſions, and kept themſelves in juſt dealing with others, and a tranquillitie of minde to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But wee come ſhort of the fowles, for the Stork knowes her appointed times, and of the beaſts, for the Oxe knowes his Maſter, but wee know not our maker, and even in the leaſt of creeping things, the Ant provides in Summer, what muſt keepe her in Winter, and wee ſhould bee likewiſe to gather here what ſhould be needful for us at our going hence. In every man and woman God hath infuſed a reaſonable ſoule; and in every ſoule hath ſet up a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the light of reaſon, to guide the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20864:99"/> underſtanding, and when we com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit ſinne, this candle is for the time ſmothered betweene Sathan and our owne corruption, or elſe wee ſhould not ſinn with the greedines we doe. How can yee ſay, that the man hath reaſon, that drinkes himſelfe into a beaſt, when no beaſt will be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate? How doth the Gallant underſtand himſelfe, when he layes his life to pawne, nay, his ſoule with his life, in a triviall quarrell? What reaſon hath the blaſphemer for his ſwearing, or the adulterer for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the houſes of death? Surely, if our underſtanding were cleare, as God made it, we ſhould never ſinne, and therefore it is not without a cauſe, that Gods children are wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here to bee wiſe, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that ſo wee may conſider our later end, which is the object, aime, and end of all our wiſdome, and underſtanding; and ſo we come to the laſt part.</p>
               <p>Is there then ſo great wiſdome, and underſtanding, to know that we
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20864:99"/> muſt all die, we all know that well enough. Oh, but to conſider this, that is ſo well known, as we ſhould, is a point of higheſt wiſdome and deepeſt underſtanding to know it, ſo, as to conſider it as it ought to bee conſidered, is a point of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to him that will have any care of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>To conſider our later end, is ſo to judge of earthly things that they may helpe us to a bleſſed end, for <hi>finis coronat opus:</hi> and hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members his later end as hee ſhould doe, ſhall never ſinne, as the wiſe man ſaith. It will be a ſcar-crow to him to keepe him from ſinne, when he conſiders of it, and himſelfe as he ſhould doe. Who is he amongſt us all, that doth conſider of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings heaped upon us, as he ought to doe? He might have made us inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures, as ſtones in the wall, onely vegetative creatures, as trees, or herbes, ſenſible creatures, as Todes or the like: But he hath made us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures; and that not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20864:100"/> and Turkes to worſhip the Divell and the murtherer <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> inſtead of GOD, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and amongſt them, not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and Schiſmaticks, but bred up with the ſincere milke of the Word of GOD, in the pureſt Church that God hath now in the whole world. O who is then a wiſe and underſtanding man, that will not conſider this, to advance and magnifie the goodneſſe of the Lord unto him, who by ſo many ſteps of mercy and goodneſſe hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him above all the creatures of the world? And as this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould moove us to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to GOD; ſo it would keepe us in obedience towards him, for to what end have wee all theſe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God, but that we ſhould remember to glorifie him that hath beſtowed them, and to fit our ſelves for that future glory which hee hath reſerved for us at our later end.</p>
               <p>Oh then that they would be wiſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20864:100"/> and underſtand, and conſider their later end: their later end, that is, their death; that they muſt die, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as wel as know it, and ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for that which cannot be avoided. Death ſhall gnaw them as ſheepe, ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> as ſheep doth the graſſe, ſome now, ſome anone, the whole paſture over in a while, and then as the freſh graſs ſprings up, ſo death comes over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and crops it; yet ſtill the root remaines; there is a root of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which death cannot take from us: but how ſoone we ſhall be cropt off by death no man knowes, we may reckon of years, and perhaps not live a weeke, or a day, nay this night the ſheet that covers thee, may be thy winding ſheet before to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. What manner of men ſhould we be in holines and righteouſnes of life, if wee did thus conſider of death; and how much doth it concerne us, to conſider and prepare for our later end, which is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, unto us? All worldly things
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20864:101"/> honour, riches, pleaſures, nay, life it ſelfe hath an end, but that end is not the end of us: there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to bee conſidered in that word, namely what followeth that end, and that is judgement, for the ſame day wee dye, are wee brought to judgement, and called to the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt accompt that can poſſibly bee imagined, not to anſwer for our owne ſinnes alone, but for <hi>Adams,</hi> and for our corruption which came from him, and for the ſinnes of thoſe that ſhall come after us, whom our ill example, or neglect of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath corrupted; and not for deeds alone, but for words alſo; and not for wicked and ſinfull words but for idle words, even for every idle word, and for our very thoughts. O Lord, what ſhall wee ſinfull wretches doe when we come to this accompt? who let us take as much care as wee can of our words, even in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and beſt devotions, yet we ſhall ſhew our imperfections and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes even then: how great then is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20864:101"/> the numberleſſe number of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities when they ſhall bee gathered together into one totall, how ſhould wee anſwer for one of a thouſand? let us then conſider ſeriouſly of this great and ſtrict accompt, and provide our ſelves of a Saviour that may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our miſdeeds, and the errours of our words and thoughts, that they may not bee imputed unto us in that judgement.</p>
               <p>From which conſideration of a judgement, there may be alſo further conſidered that there is a Hell, a place of torment, where the wicked ſhall have their particular being with the Divell and his Angels whom they ſerved in this life, ſeparated from the joyfull preſence of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saviour, in whoſe face, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect joy for evermore, and if there were no further paine of ſenſe in hell, but this <hi>poena damni,</hi> only this deprivation of God's preſence, that were a hell ſufficient of it ſelf, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there is added paines of ſenſe, fire eternall, utter darkneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:20864:102"/>
               <p>But withall, this conſideration of the Judgement, which ſhewes ſuch terrible things to the wicked, brings the faithfull to another iſſue, the bliſſe and heaven and everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the comforts and joyes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it lyeth not in my power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, nor in the heart of any man to conceive; but there will bee the full fruition of what wee hope for here, and an abſolute deliverance from all thoſe things, which trouble or feare us here.</p>
               <p>And yet I have not done; one thing more this conſderation of our end brings us to; namely, that wee muſt not end when we come to our end: but there is an eternitie that attends us after-wards, whether of life to ſalvation, or of eternal confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And this is a conſideration of weight indeed. I read of a good Chriſtian in time of perſecution who being condemned to die for his conſcience, his wife perſwaded him to yeeld to the kings will, and ſave his life, why, (ſaith hee) how long
